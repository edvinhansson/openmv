# OpenMV
An open source metroidvania.

Created from the ground up in C99.

I'm creating this project to build the foundations for many games to come.
It is designed as an engine that *I* want to use - which doesn't necessarily
make it a good engine. It is designed with open-world platform games in mind.

## Features
 - [x] Basic Rendering.
 - [x] Resource management.
 - [x] Code hot-reloading for game logic.
 - [ ] Physics.
 - [ ] Audio.
 - [ ] In-game GUI.
 - [ ] Debug IMGUI.

 - [ ] Room system.
 - [ ] Tilemap system.
 - [ ] Advanced Rendering (Post processing fx, etc.).
 - [ ] Actually make a damn game.
